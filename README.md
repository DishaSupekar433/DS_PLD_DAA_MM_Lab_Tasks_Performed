2. Write a program to create singly linked list, and perform insertion, deletion and updation of items of the list.
3. Write a program to implement stack using arrays.
4. Write a program to evaluate a given postfix expression using stacks.
5. Write a program to convert a given infix expression to postfix form using stacks.
6. Write a program to implement a stack using two queues such that the push operation runs in constant time and the pop operation runs in linear time.
7. Write a program to implement queues using arrays.
8. Write a program to implement double ended queue (de queue) using arrays.
9. Write a program to implement a queue using two stacks such that the en queue operation runs in constant time and de queue operation runs in constant time.

12. Write a program to implement following sorting algorithms i) Selection Sort ii) Insertion Sort.
13. Write a program for implementation of graph traversals by applying (a) BFS (b) DFS.

# Programming Logic Design 
1. Identify three problems that might arise at home, college, or in a business that could be solved more efficiently with computer assistance. Draw flowcharts and write pseudocode for the same.
2. Scientists have determined that the worldâ€™s ocean levels are currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year. Write an algorithm and draw a flow chart to display:
    The number of millimeters that the oceans will rise in five years
    The number of millimeters that the oceans will rise in seven years
    The number of millimeters that the oceans will rise in ten years
3. Program to study Life and scope of variables in C.
4. Program to study structures, functions, and arrays. Write a program using functions for the payroll system. Declare an array of records to store information of employees. Develop functions to read information, calculate salary, and print salary details in a tabular form. Implement the program using global data or passing structures as parameters to functions. Define salary calculations based on basic salary ranges.
5. Iterative control structures and 2D arrays, with graphics animation.
6. Write a program in an object-oriented language to understand the concepts of data abstraction and encapsulation:
    Result of 5 students
    Write a program in C++ for the grocery shop to prepare the bill of a customer.
7. Write a program in an object-oriented language to understand the concept of class inheritance. Declare a base class student with fields for roll number and marks in two subjects. Derive another class with additional attributes for total marks and percentage. Read marks and roll number and print the result from the derived class.
8. Write a program in an object-oriented language to understand the concept of class polymorphism. Declare multiple functions with the same name but different prototypes. Access these overloaded functions depending on the values entered by the user at runtime.
9. Study default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
10. Extra:
    Write a program to demonstrate the use of a concurrent programming language.
    Write a simple expert system using a functional programming language.
    Write a program to demonstrate the use of a logical programming language.
